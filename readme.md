Agda URL implementation
===

This is an Agda implementation of URLs as defined in <https://alwinb.github.io/url-specification/>

The goal is to eventually be able to write proofs about some of the interesting properties established therein and possibly others.

To try it out, the `Main/AgdaURL.agda` serves as an entry point. After compiling it, simply write a target URL as the first line to stdin, a base URL as the second line, and it should output information about the parsed URLs and the resolved URL to stdout.

~~~ bash
agda --ghc Main/AgdaURL.agda
./AgdaURL <<< $'url-specification/#parsing\nhttps://alwinb.github.io'
~~~

For now, only parsing is implemented, and host parsing is incomplete.

- **TODO:** Implement a better host parser.
- **TODO:** Implement punycoding.
- **TODO:** Implement percent‐encoding.
- **TODO:** Implement normalization.
- **TODO:** Write proofs for the URL operation properties.
- **TODO:** Test against the WPT suite.

Ideas, sugestions and any other forms of feedback are all welcome!
